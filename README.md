# Synopsis
## Setting
The story is set in a world where Devils (悪魔, Akuma) are born from human fears. Devils are usually dangerous and malevolent, their power is proportional to the fear they incite. However, humans can form contracts with them to use their power, and there are individuals specializing in hunting and employing them, called Devil Hunters (デビルハンター, Debiru Hantā). Devils originate from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth and Hell: they migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice versa. Dwelling in Hell are extremely powerful Devils called Primal Fears, which have never been killed. Transit between planes appears to be overseen by the Hell Devil (地獄の悪魔, Jigoku no Akuma).

A Devil may, in certain conditions, inhabit the body of a dead human, gaining some of their memories and personality; such a creature is called a Fiend (魔人, Majin, lit. Demonic Person). In rare cases, a living Fiend Host is possible where the dead human is able to retain their personality and balance control of the body with their inhabitant, who they are able to directly converse with. Devils who naturally have a humanoid form are said to be benevolent to humans.

The events of the story take place in 1997, in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, and many events such as the Holocaust, AIDS and nuclear weapons are revealed to have been erased from history and have ceased to exist entirely due to the consumption of their respective Devils by the Chainsaw Devil, with only a powerful group of devils known as the Four Horsemen remembering the original events. Likewise, there has been no war since the First World War as the War Devil has been weakened to the point that the only traces of war exist in pop culture and media.

## Plot
**Part 1 – Public Safety arc**
Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the condition that Denji shows his dreams to Pochita. Denji massacres the yakuza, and is approached by a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, who persuades him to join their ranks. Agreeing, Denji is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend, and Aki Hayakawa, a self-destructive Devil Hunter. Makima promises Denji any favor, provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of the greatest massacre in human history.

Several missions later, Denji's group encounters another hybrid, the Katana Man, a vengeful yakuza seemingly allied with the Gun Devil, attacks the Division. Makima and devil hunter Kobeni Higashiyama managed to repel the yakuza, but they lost a great portion of the Division, including Aki's partner Himeno. In order to match them, Denji and Power are trained by Kishibe, a master Devil-hunter who distrusts Makima; Aki makes a deal with the Future Devil, who foresees a "horrible death" for him. The Division launches a counter-attack against the Katana Man, capturing him. Some time later, Denji meets and begins a romance with a woman named Reze, who is actually the Bomb Devil, a Hybrid spy for the Soviet Union, sent to capture him. Though returning his affection, she attacks the city, with the Division barely saving Denji. After recovering, Denji fights her, and accepts a proposal to leave Japan together; before they can reunite, Makima secretly captures her, though her true motivation remains unknown. Denji's fight with Bomb Devil reveals his existence to the world.

Foreign assassin groups target Denji: Chinese hunter and Kishibe's former partner, Quanxi; a mysterious enemy of Makima called "Santa Claus"; three American brothers; and a Russian woman teaching a pupil, Tolka. Denji is outfitted with a security detail including Hirofumi Yoshida, a Private Sector Devil Hunter contracting the Octopus Devil. Though the brothers are repelled, and Quanxi initially stalls, Santa Claus uses their Doll Devil powers for a large horde attack. After a follow-up by Quanxi, Tolka's master reveals herself as the true "Santa Claus", and has all parties transported to Hell, where they are attacked by the Darkness Devil. Santa Claus makes a contract with the Darkness Devil that empowers her. Makima retrieves the group from Hell, and Quanxi (who is revealed to be a hybrid) helps Denji defeat Santa Claus; Makima dispatches her afterwards. Following the incident, several devil hunters resigns, including Kobeni.

After Denji recovers, Makima reveals the Gun Devil is actually a geopolitical asset, with many factions controlling pieces of it. As Aki begs Makima for Denji's safety, the president of the United States orders the Gun Devil to attack Japan and kill Makima. Revealed to be the Control Devil, Makima confronts the Gun Devil and wins. Aki dies in the attack, and the Gun Devil takes his body as a Fiend. Denji is attacked by the Gun Fiend, and, helped by civilians, kills it; Aki's death devastates him. While seemingly consoling him, Makima kills Power, revealing herself responsible for Denji's losses, having plotted to void his contract with Pochita by crushing his dreams of a normal life.

Kishibe attacks her, and she calls for "Chainsaw Man" to save her. Controlling Denji's body, Pochita assumes his true form and runs, taking Kobeni with him. Makima explains her goals: to use Pochita's power to eliminate concepts from reality to create a world without suffering; to this end, she was empowered by the government with immortality. Fighting the Chainsaw Man using the brainwashed Hybrids, which include Katana Man, Reze, and Quanxi, she wins, as Denji's heroic deeds have weakened Pochita who saves Kobeni. However, Power revives as the Blood Devil from a remnant of her blood from Denji, escapes with Chainsaw Man, and, mortally wounded, restores Denji's will to live, having him promise to find her when she is reborn in Hell.

Invigorated by public support for him, Denji confronts Makima for one last time and defeats her; to bypass her immortality, he eats her body. Later, Kishibe reveals the Control Devil resurfaced in the form of a little girl, now named Nayuta. He asks Denji to look after her, and Pochita supports this mission in Denji's dreams. Later, Denji enrolls in high school and continues fighting devils under the public eye.

**Part 2 – School arc**
Asa Mitaka is an introverted high school student attending Fourth East High School, who has trouble finding her place in society following her mother's death to the Typhoon Devil. One day, after accidentally killing her class' pet devil Bucky, she is confronted by a student who has made a contract with the Justice Devil. The student attempts to kill Asa, but Yoru the War Devil appears and makes a contract with Asa, inhabting her body and making her a living Fiend host, under the condition that she kills Chainsaw Man. After dispatching her killer, Asa seeks to find Chainsaw Man, though she and Yoru have differing goals: Asa wants Yoru to leave her body, while Yoru wants to reclaim the Nuclear Weapons Devil which was consumed by Pochita. They join the school's Devil Hunter Club, where they are partnered with Yoshida and Yuko, an outgoing student who becomes friends with her.

Meanwhile, Denji has adapted to his new life as a normal high school student, also attending Fourth East, while using his newfound fame as Chainsaw Man to attract women. Yoshida keeps tabs on him under an unknown mission. Knowing that Denji is desperate for a girlfriend, Yoshida introduces Denji to Asa, who attempts to reveal to her that he is Chainsaw Man, but fails.

Asa later discovers that Yuko formed a contract with the Justice Devil and plans on enacting revenge on everyone who bullied Asa. Using Yoru's devil abilities, Asa confronts her, but accidentally slices Yuko into several pieces. At that moment, "Yoru's sister" appears and revives Yuko, turning her into a giant devil rampaging through the school. Denji attacks devil Yuko, but she escapes. The now-disfigured Yuko bids farewell to Asa and goes on the run for help, but a mysterious second Chainsaw Man dispatches her.

Following the incident, Asa and Yoru meets Haruka Iseumi, the President of both the Devil Hunter's Club and the student council, who has taken interest in her. "Yoru's sister" also reveals herself to be the Famine Devil named Fami who's also a devil hunter club member. Haruka tells Yoru that he is Chainsaw Man, showing her a starting cord attached to his chest as proof. Seemingly convinced, Asa starts a relationship with Denji in hopes of using him as a weapon against Chainsaw Man, unaware of his true nature.

After meeting Makima, he becomes a Public Safety Devil Hunter, to live in humane conditions, although the public sees him as a hero for his heroic deeds. His initial primary motivation is his attraction to Makima, but later after her death, his motivation shifts to using his newfound superhero fame as the Chainsaw Man to attract as many women as possible, especially trying to expose his own identity.

Now sharing the same body, Yoru forces Asa into her vendetta to eliminate Chainsaw Man and reclaim the Nuclear Weapons Devil from him, though her opinions on him remain neutral.
